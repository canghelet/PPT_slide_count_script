Hello!

This is my script written in Python that counts the number of slides in PowerPoint decks.

1. The script will be executed by entering "python PPT_slide_count_script -s -f name of the PPT file/files" command on the Terminal window.
2. As input, the script will take one or more PowerPoint files and will provide a report showing the number of slides for each deck, the name of the deck and a summary with total number of slides for all the decks that were processed.
